Hello There,

I'm Nwajiunor, a data scientist from Lagos, Nigeria. I recently transitioned into this exciting field from the field of architecture. I believe my background in architecture when combined with my expertise in data science provides me with a unique set of skills to approach challenges from fresh perspectives.

I am interested in the Accessibility Features Documentation project because I find it interesting that I can use data analysis techniques to prioritize accessibility features and topics that can be addressed in the documentation. I see Outreachy with Wagtail as an opportunity to apply my expertise in a meaningful way while contributing to a project with a strong social impact. Although I have made a first-timer contribution before, this will be my first time contributing extensively over a period of weeks.

A fun spoiler about me: I'm a delightful mix of introvert and extrovert tendencies, leaning towards the introverted side (shh, it's our little secret. Don't tell anyone ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ). For leisure, I like surfing the internet to find out what's happening around the world and around me. I look forward to having an amazing collaborative experience here.
